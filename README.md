# TRIM - TRansformers for tracking Inertial Measurements

---
![](docs/figs/method_position.png)

Existing methods for inferring pose estimation from IMU
measurements typically employ either multiple IMUs or integrate IMUs
with additional sensors like cameras or LiDAR. Recent work involves
data-driven approaches utilizing deep learning models such as CNNs and
RNNs to predict position from a single IMU. However, these techniques
often specialize in predicting either position or orientation or confine
predictions to 2D space. In this paper, we aim to predict the 6-DoF
pose of an object directly from 6D measurements of a single IMU. We
present transformer-based architectures for direct orientation prediction
and for predicting denoised velocities and accelerations. Our proposed
method is evaluated on the TUM-VIE dataset and demonstrates superior
performance compared to previous models.
